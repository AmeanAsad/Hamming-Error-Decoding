# Syndrome-Error-Decoding


I developed a class that is able to develop any (n, k) linear code including by generating a generator matrix, parity check matrix, 
and a syndrome decoding table. I used that class to develop an ASCII code class in order to correct errors in the ascii representation 
of alphabet letters. 

I developed a stochastic simulation in order to test the accuracy of different error correcting codes. This was done by  
writing a random text generator. Thanks to https://www.wordfrequency.info/ for supplying me with a 5000 word data set. 

Here are some results from the simulation:
